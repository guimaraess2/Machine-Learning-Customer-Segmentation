# Machine-Learning-Customer-Segmentation
Customer segmentation KMeans algorithm
Today it is essential to know your customer and 
 your consumption pattern of each one, and to know which customers are more likely to buy certain types and brands of products.

And how can data science help us?

There are several algorithms with different approaches that can perform grouping to discover buying habits, market segmentation, direct mail, Netflix customer profiles, news grouping, social media analysis, grouping of similar products and much more.

In this approach I will use the KMeans algorithm that works with Clustering, which is a set of techniques used to partition data into groups called clusters. Clusters are defined as groups of data objects that are more similar to other objects in your cluster than to data objects in other clusters.
